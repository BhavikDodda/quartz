Treatment for [[1. Water#^1a9b58|domestic use]]
## Requirements for drinking water
1. Clear and Odourless and devoid of unpleasant taste.
2. Devoid of heavy metals and arsenic
3. Free from pathogenic microorganisms
4. pH~8
5. Suspended matter<10ppm
6. Dissolved salts<500ppm

## Natural water treated for domestic use
1. Aeration of raw water: passing compressed air to remove odour
2. Sedimentation
	1. Settling in a large tang
	2. Adding coagulants (in the form of solution) for colloidal particles
		1. Alum: K₂SO₄
		2. Green vitriol: FeSO₄
3. Precipitates contain
	1. Aluminium, ferrous, ferric hydroxides
	2. Bacteria
3. Partially clarified water is filtered through sand gravity filters: rectangular tanks which contain fine layers of sand

# Sterilization

## 1. By adding bleaching powder
1kg/1000kl of powder and treated water should contain <0.2ppm Cl
* CaOCl₂+H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + Cl₂
* Cl₂ + H₂O → HCl + HOCl
HOCl kills the bacteria

### Advantage
1. Effective, economical
2. Does not make water hard
3. Required little storage
### Disadvantage
1. Imparts unpleasant taste and odour
2. Lowers pH below 6.5 and causes irritation to mucus membrane

## 2. Breakpoint chlorination

When liquid chlorine is added or gas is passed
1. Available Cl decreases: consumption of it in oxidizing some organic matter
2. Increases due to decomposition of chloro-organic compounds
Free chlorine: destruction of bacteria.
Breakpoint: point at which residual chlorine begins to appear

### Advantages
1. Organic matter is oxidized⇒Odour-free
2. Pathogenic bacteria are destroyed
3. Prevents growth of weed in water

## 3. Chloramine

Cl+NH₃ mixed in 2:1 by volume
* Cl₂ + NH₃ → ClNH₂ + HCl
* ClNH₂ + H₂O → HOCl + NH₃
* HOCl → HCl + \[O\]

\[O\] nascent oxygen also has bactericidal properties.

## 4. Ozonation
Ozone is unstable and gives \[O\]

### Advantage
1. Sterilization, bleaching, decolorization and deodourazation take place at the same time
2. Does not change pH
3. Time of contact is only 10-15min

### Disadvantage
1. Costly

# Desalination of Brackish Water
Water containing dissolved salts and having a very salty taste is called brackish water. 
Eg: sea water
## 1. Electrodialysis

By applying current and employing pair of plastic membranes through which ions can pass
* Cathode(-): Attracts +ve
* Anode(+): Attracts -ve

## 2. Reverse Osmosis
Osmosis: Flow of solvent from dilute to concentrated solution through a semipermeable membrane.
Reverse osmosis: flow of solvent in oppositie direction.
(Done by applying pressure)

### Advantages
1. Removal of ionic, non-ionic, colloidal solutes
2. Renegeneration is easy: replacement of semipermeable membrane
3. Economical
4. Continuous supply of large volumes of water

Usually used for purification of sea water for domestic use.
