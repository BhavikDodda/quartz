**_Tacticity_**Â describes the stereochemistry of the repeated units in polymer chains. It refers to how groups are arranged along the polymeric backbone of a chain.

1. Isotactic
	1. Have all groups in one side of the backbone
	2. Monomers are joined in regular head to head
2. Syndiotactic
	1. Groups appear on opposite sides of backbone alternatively
3. Atactic
	1. Groups are arranged randomly along the backbone
	2. These materials are soft, elastic, rubbery.
	3. Sidegroups are randomly oriented.

eg: Atactic polypropylene is amorphous^[non defined form], rubbery of little value unlike isotactic polypropene.
