Three ways of addition polymerization
1. Head to tail type
2. Head to head type
3. Random type

Mechanisms:
# 1. Free radical polymerization
1. Initiation
	1. Spontaneous decomposition of an initiator into free radicals R*
	2. Addition of the radical from 1. to the monomer to form **primary radical/initiator radical** M* to initiate the chain.
2. Propagation: M*+M
3. Termination: by
	1. Collision between two growing chains
	2. growing chain+M*
	3. growing chain+inhibitors
	4. Happens rarely: disproportionation of an H atom from one radical to another: 1 unsaturated+1 saturated polymers

# 2. Ionic
Instead of free radicals, here the unstable intermediates are: cations or anions
Consists of the same steps:
1. Initiation
	1. Cationic mechanism: Lewis acids like AlCl₃, BF₃, H₂SO₄
2. Propagaion
3. Termination
	1. In cationic mechanism: terminator=anion
	2. In anionic mechanism: terminator=cation

> Polymerization of olefins with metallic sodium, sodium ethoxide takes place via Anionic addition polymerization.

# 3. Coordination
Also called **Ziegler-Natta** polymerization
Transition metal halides with organometallic compounds, polymerization of olefins leads to stereospecific polymerization.
1. Initiation with **Cat R'**
2. Propagation
3. Termination with HX

Helps to form HDPE (High density polyethylene)
