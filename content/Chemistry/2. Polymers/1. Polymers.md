Polymers: Macromolecules of high molecular weight which are formed by linkage between large numbers of small molecules called monomers.

Eg: Ethylene + Ethylene + ... = Polythene

# Types

Polymers can be classified in many different ways: 

1.  On the basis of source: 
    
    1.  Natural: Starch, Cellulose, Natural Rubber, DNA, RNA 
        
    2.  Synthetic: PE, PVC, PS 
        
2.  On the basis of repeating units: 
    
    1.  Homopolymers: repeating monomer units are same. 
        
    2.  Co-polymers: More than one type of monomers are present. Ex: Nylon 6,6, PEVA, ABS 
        
3.  Structure 
    
    1.  Linear 
        
    2.  Branched 
        
    3.  3 dimensional 
        
    4.  Cross-linked 
        
4.  On the basis of arrangement of functional groups, side chain or branches 
    
    1.  [[4.1 Stereochemistry of Polymers|Classification on the basis of tacticity]] 
        
        1.  Isotactic 
            
        2.  Syndiotactic: alternate arrangement 
            
        3.  Atactic: randomly arranged 
            
5.  On the basis of molecular forces 
    
    1.  [[6. Thermoplastics|Thermoplastics]] 
        
        1.  They are linear long chain polymers which can be softened on heating and hardened on cooling. 
            
        2.  Ex: PE, PP, PS 
            
    2.  [[7. Thermosetting Resins|Thermosetting plastic]] 
        
        1.  They have crosslinked 3D network which once hardened cannot be softened or reversed again. 
            
        2.  Ex: Bakelite, Melamine, epoxy resin, polyester. 
            
    3.  Elastomers are rubber like elastic polymers which can be stretched at least 3 times their original form. 
        
    4.  Fibers 
        
        1.  They are polymeric chains which are held by strong intermolecular forces like H bonding.  
            
        2.  Eg: Starch, cellulose, Nylon 
            
6.  On the basis of synthesis 
    
    1.  [[2. Addition Polymerization|Addition polymers]] 
        
        1.  They are formed when the repeating units are added one by one to the main chain. 
            
        2.  Most of the times they are formed by free radical/cationic/anionic form. 
            
        3.  Monomers always have one or more double bonds 
            
    2.  [[3. Condensation Polymerization|Condensation polymers]] 
        
        1.  2 different types of monomeric units react through their functional groups and combine together. 
            
        2.  Elimination of strong molecule like water, ammonia. 
            
        3.  Ex: Nylon 6,6 
            
        4.  PDI: polydispersity index: Mₘ/Mₙ
